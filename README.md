# polimi-graduating-info

Congratulations for graduating at PoliMi! Are you frustrated because you don't know what time the ceremony will be held and your invitees just want to know? Yeah we've all been there. 

I wrote this quick and dirty script while attending a boring lecture, feel free to use it so that you get to know the ceremony information as soon as they are published.
